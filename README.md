# PromptForge ‚ö°

**Author:** Claudel MUBENZEM

## üöÄ Description

PromptForge is a browser extension designed to supercharge your interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). It helps you craft, optimize, and refine your prompts directly on your favorite AI chat platforms, leading to better, more accurate, and more insightful results.

Instead of just writing a simple prompt, PromptForge allows you to apply powerful optimization algorithms that restructure and enrich your query with context, specific instructions, and better formatting.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Seamless Integration:** Injects a simple, non-intrusive UI directly into supported LLM chat interfaces.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Choose from multiple algorithms to enhance your prompts.
  - **Primer:** A quick and efficient algorithm for fast, effective prompt improvements.
  - **Mastermind:** A more advanced algorithm that adds detailed sections for context, approach, and instructions to your prompt.
- **Loading Indicator:** A visual overlay shows you when your prompt is being optimized.
- **Platform-Aware:** Intelligently detects the correct input field on each supported platform.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Write Your Prompt:** Type your initial prompt into the text area of a supported AI chat website as you normally would.
2.  **Open PromptForge:** Hover over the floating brain icon (üß†) to reveal the PromptForge popup.
3.  **Choose an Algorithm:** Select either the "Primer" or "Mastermind" optimization algorithm.
4.  **Optimize:** Click the "Optimize Prompt" button.
5.  **Get Results:** PromptForge sends your text to a backend service, which applies the chosen algorithm. The original text in the input box is then replaced with the newly optimized prompt.

## üåê Supported Platforms

PromptForge is designed to work with the following LLM platforms:

- **ChatGPT** (`chat.openai.com`, `chatgpt.com`)
- **Google Gemini** (`gemini.google.com`)
- **DeepSeek** (`chat.deepseek.com`)
